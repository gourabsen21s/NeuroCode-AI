# Progress

## What's Working
- User authentication system with JWT
- Project creation and management
- User collaboration on projects
- Real-time chat functionality with Socket.IO
- AI integration via @ai commands using Google's Gemini model
- Basic WebContainer integration for in-browser code execution
- MongoDB database integration
- Frontend React application with Vite
- Backend Express.js API
- Comprehensive documentation page with error handling

## What's Left to Build
- Enhanced WebContainer integration for more robust code execution
- Dynamic code examples in documentation
- Advanced search functionality for documentation
- Improved file tree management and persistence
- More advanced AI code generation capabilities
- Enhanced error handling and edge case management
- User interface improvements for better collaboration
- Additional IDE features for code editing
- Testing infrastructure and comprehensive test cases

## Current Status
The project has a functional MVP with core features implemented including user authentication, project management, real-time collaboration, AI assistance, and documentation. Added a comprehensive user documentation page with detailed guides for all platform features. Fixed initial rendering issues with the documentation page by implementing error boundaries and better error handling. Currently focusing on enhancing the WebContainer integration, documentation enhancements, and improving the overall user experience.

## Known Issues
- Occasional Socket.IO connection stability issues
- AI response formatting needs improvement for complex code generation
- WebContainer has limitations for certain types of projects
- UI/UX needs refinement for better collaboration experience
- Need more robust error handling for edge cases
- Documentation might need further expansion for advanced use cases

## Recently Completed
- Fixed documentation page white screen issue with error boundaries
- Added error handling for smooth page navigation
- Created comprehensive user documentation page
- Added documentation route to the application
- Fixed JSX encoding issues
- Updated memory bank with detailed project information
- Initial project setup with MERN stack
- JWT authentication implementation
- Socket.IO integration for real-time communication

## Blocked By
- WebContainer API limitations for certain use cases
- AI model performance considerations for complex coding tasks
- Need for more comprehensive testing framework
- Performance optimization for real-time collaboration with many users

## Project Health
The project is in a healthy state with a functional MVP. Core features are working as expected, with identified areas for improvement. The codebase is well-structured following MVC patterns, and the technology choices align well with the project goals. The addition of comprehensive documentation improves the user experience and onboarding process. Recent fixes to the documentation page demonstrate the project's commitment to ensuring a reliable user experience. Next steps focus on enhancing existing features, expanding documentation, and addressing known limitations.
