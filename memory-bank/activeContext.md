# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on enhancing user experience through improved documentation and guidance. A comprehensive documentation page has been added to help users understand all features of the platform, including project collaboration, real-time chat, AI assistance, WebContainer execution, and file management. Recent fixes have resolved initial rendering issues with the documentation page.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed documentation page rendering issues with proper error handling
- Added error boundary to the documentation page to prevent white screen issues
- Created a detailed documentation page with comprehensive user guides
- Added the documentation route to the application
- Fixed HTML encoding in JSX elements for proper rendering
- Updated memory bank with comprehensive project information
- Connected Socket.IO for real-time chat functionality
- Integrated AI assistant (@ai) capabilities with Google's Gemini model
- Implemented secure JWT authentication
- Added project collaboration features

## Next Steps
- Enhance the WebContainer integration for better code execution
- Add dynamic code snippets to the documentation
- Improve AI prompt handling and response formatting
- Optimize file tree management and persistence
- Add more robust error handling for real-time communication
- Enhance UI/UX for easier project navigation and collaboration

## Active Decisions
- Use Google's Gemini model instead of other AI alternatives
- Implement WebContainer API for in-browser code execution
- Structure project with MERN stack for full JavaScript ecosystem
- Deploy on Azure for reliability and scaling capabilities
- Create comprehensive documentation for improved user onboarding
- Add error boundaries to prevent component rendering failures

## Open Questions
- How to optimize the AI response handling for code generation?
- What additional security measures should be implemented for collaborative coding?
- How to handle WebContainer limitations for larger projects?
- Best approach for scaling the Socket.IO implementation?
- How to implement more advanced IDE features while maintaining simplicity?
- What additional documentation sections might be needed for new users?

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent real-time synchronization between collaborators
- Optimizing AI response handling for code suggestions
- Managing WebContainer execution environment limitations
- Balancing feature richness with performance considerations
- Handling secure authentication for collaborative sessions
- Creating clear and comprehensive documentation that addresses all user needs
- Preventing and handling UI rendering errors efficiently

## Notes from Recent Discussions
Comprehensive documentation has been added to improve user experience, with initial rendering issues now resolved. The documentation page includes detailed guides on all platform features organized into sections with smooth scrolling navigation. Added error boundaries and better error handling to prevent UI failures. The memory bank structure provides an effective way to maintain context between development sessions. The project continues to focus on enhancing collaborative features while ensuring a smooth user experience.
