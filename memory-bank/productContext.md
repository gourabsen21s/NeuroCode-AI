# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional development environments often require complex local setup and don't facilitate real-time collaboration. Developers need tools to work together seamlessly while leveraging AI assistance and executing code without the overhead of local environment configuration.

## Target Users
- Professional software developers working in teams
- Student developers collaborating on academic projects
- Coding instructors and mentors providing real-time assistance
- Hackathon participants needing quick collaboration
- Remote development teams

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive, minimal-friction user interface
- Seamless project creation and collaboration
- Real-time communication with team members and AI
- Immediate code execution without complex setup
- Simple file management and project structure

## Key Features
- User authentication and project management
- Real-time collaborative chat with @ai assistance
- WebContainer-based code execution in browser
- Project structure management and file system
- AI-powered code generation and suggestions
- Multi-user collaboration with permissions

## User Flows
1. User registration and login
2. Project creation and collaborator invitation
3. Code/file editing with real-time collaborative chat
4. Using @ai commands to generate code or get help
5. Executing code directly in the browser via WebContainer
6. Managing project file structure

## Competitive Landscape
- GitHub Codespaces: More feature-rich but requires more resources
- Replit: Similar collaborative coding but doesn't focus as much on AI integration
- CodeSandbox: Focuses on frontend development preview
- Devin AI: Inspiration for the project but with different implementation and focus

## Future Vision
Expand the platform to include more advanced IDE features, integrated CI/CD pipelines, enhanced AI capabilities for code review and optimization, and additional language/framework support. Create a comprehensive development environment that minimizes the gap between ideation and execution.
