# Project Brief: NeuroCode-AI

## Overview
NeuroCode-AI is a collaborative AI-powered development platform where users can create projects, invite collaborators, chat in real time, and leverage AI-powered code generation. Inspired by Devin AI, this platform allows seamless project management and execution directly in the browser using WebContainer technology.

## Core Requirements
- User authentication and project management system
- Real-time collaboration and chat capabilities
- AI-assisted code generation via @ai prompts
- Browser-based code execution environment
- File system management and project structure generation

## Project Scope
- User registration, login, and account management
- Project creation and collaborative access control
- Real-time messaging with AI assistance capabilities
- In-browser code execution via WebContainer
- File system management and project structure generation
- Out-of-scope: CI/CD pipelines, extensive IDE features beyond basic coding

## Success Metrics
- Functional user authentication system
- Working real-time collaboration features
- Successful AI code generation capabilities
- Functional in-browser code execution
- User-friendly interface for project management

## Timeline
- MVP development: Q1-Q2 2024
- Beta release: Q3 2024
- Production deployment on Azure: Q3-Q4 2024

## Stakeholders
- Development team
- Testing team
- End users (developers looking for collaborative coding platforms)
- Project management

## Additional Notes
This project aims to create a streamlined, collaborative development environment that leverages AI to boost productivity while allowing developers to build and execute code directly in the browser.
